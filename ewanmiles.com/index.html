        <p>I was elected as Social Executive by the physics student body as part of the 2019/20 commitee for the UCL Physics Society. The role, which required a lot of organisation

            included the rest of the committee and working directly with others. It provided me with a fantastic learning experience and developed my whole skillset.</p>

        <p>One of the most influential experiences of my life so far, I was part of a trip to South Korea with the BBC 
            for a project to record a programme contrasting schooling there with schooling in Wales. 
            It was an amazing and surprising experience which led to the realisation that the competition is global and 
            that it is possible to sacrifice too much when tackling issues the wrong way. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n27vnnl3" target="_blank">Click here to watch the documentary</a>.

        <p>In addition to my training in Python, I am self-taught in the HTML/SCSS/TS trio, while currently engaged in multiple front-end projects. 
            My main project that demonstrates my skills would be <a href="https://pokerchart.co.uk" target="_blank">PokerChart</a>, a web-app I built solo
            using the Angular/Ionic frameworks. This involved learning TypeScript as a better extension to JavaScript, teaching me about strict type-setting
            and its use in debugging and error avoidance.</p>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>PokerChart allows users to track their poker play throughout the game. It doesn't have to be linked to any
            other software and can be used for live home games or in conjunction with online play. It shows you stats about
            your wins and your fold consistency among other things.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>From a technical aspect, it is the first solo project of mine connected to a Google Firebase hosted backend, which 
            allowed me to build authentication services for user accounts. It also means games can be saved on a database to be 
            observed later on. Furthermore, group games have been implemented using a room-key system, which allows other users to track
            each other's games while playing against one another. Each player is listed in the room and given a colour and, like seen above,
            players' stack sizes and average changes throughout the game are all shown on one graph to compare.</p>
        <br>
        <p>DISCLAIMER: PokerChart might still be buggy at stages, it is an ongoing project!</p>
